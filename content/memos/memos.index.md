CMDP Compliance Index (FY24–25)
## Introduction
The Command Maintenance Discipline Program (CMDP) establishes the minimum inspection requirements that all units must meet in order to maintain Army-standard maintenance discipline. This document serves as the **index page** for Project: CMDP Preparation 
Its purpose is to **educate the user**, **explain required documents**, and **provide clean navigation** to the memorandums and SOP templates needed to achieve **GO ratings** during FY24–25 CMDP inspections.

---

# BLUF: What You Must Have to Pass CMDP
The FY24–25 CMDP checklist contains several line items that explicitly require:
- **Appointment memorandums**, or  
- **Signed SOPs**, or  
- **Program memorandums**  

If a required document is **missing**, the inspector must issue a **NO-GO**, even if the unit performs the task correctly.

This index lists **only the documents that directly affect GO/NO-GO outcomes.**  Best Business practice will require more documents and references that just those identified here.
