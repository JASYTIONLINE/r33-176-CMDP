# CMDP Compliance Index (FY24–25)

## Introduction
This page provides a clear and organized reference to all **documents required** to achieve a **GO** on CMDP checklist items for FY24–25.  
Use this index to quickly locate the correct memorandum or SOP needed for compliance.  
Checklist references are provided next to each item so you can easily verify the requirement.

All documents listed here are **mandatory** because the CMDP checklist explicitly requires them.  
If a required memorandum or SOP is missing, the unit will receive a **NO-GO** on that line item.
