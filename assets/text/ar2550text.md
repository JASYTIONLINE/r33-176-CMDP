See appendix A.
1–3. Explanation of abbreviations and terms
See the glossary.

1–5. Records management (recordkeeping) requirements
The records management requirement for all record numbers, associated forms, and reports required by this regulation are addressed in the Records Retention Schedule-Army (RRS–A). Detailed information for all related record numbers, forms, and reports are located in the Army Records Information Management System (ARIMS)/RRS–A at https://www.arims.army.mil. If any record numbers, forms, and reports are not current, addressed, and/or published correctly in ARIMS/RSA–A, see DA Pam 25–403 for guidance.
1–6. Restrictions to this regulation
This regulation has been made as complete as possible to avoid issuing additional instructions. The formats for corre-spondence outlined in this regulation take precedence over format instructions outlined in other regulations or direc-tives. Therefore, command publications issued to augment this regulation will be restricted to instructions that are unique to the issuing command.
Note. When preparing correspondence for signature by the Secretary of Defense; Secretary of the Army; Chief of Staff of the Army; Under Secretary of the Army; Vice Chief of Staff of the Army; Assistant Secretaries of the Army; AASA; and other HQDA principal officials, follow the guidance in Department of Defense (DoD) 5110.04, Volume 1 and HQDA Writing and Product SOP.

AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 2
Section II
General Correspondence Guidance
1–8. Methods of communication
a. Personal or telephone contact. Conduct official business by personal contact, telephone, or Defense Switched Network, whenever possible. Use a memorandum for record (MFR) to document any decisions or agreements reached during voice communications (see para 2–7 for the proper use of an MFR).
b. Memorandum. Use the memorandum for correspondence within a department or agency, as well as for routine correspondence to Federal Government agencies outside DoD. Do not use the memorandum format when correspond-ing with the Families of military personnel or private businesses (see para 2–2 for the proper use of the memorandum).
c. Letter. Use the letter for correspondence addressed to the President or Vice President of the United States, members of the White House staff, Members of Congress, Justices of the Supreme Court, heads of departments and agencies, State Governors, mayors, foreign government officials, and the public. You may also use letters to address individuals outside the department or agency when a personal tone is appropriate, such as in letters of commendation or condolence (see para 3–2 for the proper use of a letter).
d. Electronic mail. Use email to transfer organizational and individual information.
1–9. Direct communications
Send correspondence as directly as possible to the action office concerned (see para 2–4a(5)). Include the action officer’s name and office symbol when addressing correspondence.
1–10. Routing through channels
a. Routing action correspondence. Route correspondence through commands, agencies, or offices expected to ex-ercise control or take action.
b. Bypassing intermediate headquarters. Do not route correspondence through a headquarters that has no concern in the matter or action. However, send a copy of the communication and referral action to the command, agency, or office that was bypassed. Routine correspondence may bypass intermediate headquarters when—
(1) It is apparent the intermediate headquarters is not concerned.
(2) No action is required.
(3) No controls need to be exercised.
c. Using technical channels. Use technical channels to route correspondence that deals with technical matters. This includes technical reports, instructions, or requests for information that do not involve command matters. Before using technical channels, make sure the action should not be sent through command channels. Do not use “FOR THE COMMANDER” on the authority line of technical channel correspondence.
1–11. Writing quality
In accordance with Plain Writing Act of 2010, Public Law (PL) No. 111–274, DA writing will be clear, concise, and well-organized. Army correspondence must aid effective communication and decision making. The reader must be able to understand the writer’s ideas in a single reading, and the correspondence must be free of errors in grammar, mechanics, and usage (see paras 1–37 and 1–38). Use electronic spell check when available but always proofread; spell check is only a tool and is not infallible.
1–12. Exclusive For correspondence
a. Using. Use “Exclusive For” correspondence for matters of a sensitive or privileged nature directed to a specific party or parties. Minimize its use to avoid delay of action if the named addressee is absent or unavailable to receive and act on the correspondence. Prepare “Exclusive For” correspondence in either letter or memorandum format.
b. Addressing. Address “Exclusive For” correspondence to the name and title of the addressee.
(1) For memorandums:
Memorandum Exclusive For [Full Name], [Title], [Mailing Address]
Memorandum Exclusive For Commander of [Name], [Title], [Mailing Address]
(2) For letters:
Exclusive For
Sergeant [Full Name]
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 3
[Title]
[Mailing Address]
c. Handling. When preparing “Exclusive For” correspondence, place it in a sealed envelope. Print and underline the words “Exclusive For” on the envelope. Distribution center and official mailroom workers will give this type of mail to addressees unopened unless security conditions dictate that they open the mail as part of the official mail screening process.
Section III
Specific Correspondence Guidance
1–13. Dissemination of command instructions
Use the acronym ALARACT (all Army activities) only in electronically transmitted messages. This acronym assigns responsibility for distribution instructions. Do not use it when addressing Army correspondence. See AR 25–30 and DA Pam 25–40 for preparing an ALARACT message.
1–14. Unique capitalization
The following is a selection of style and usage preferences for internal Army correspondence:
a. Capitalize the word “Soldier” when it refers to a U.S. Army Soldier.
b. Capitalize the word “Family” when it refers to U.S. Army Family or Family members.
c. Capitalize the word “Civilian” when it refers to Army Civilians and is used in conjunction with Soldier and/or Family.
1–15. Abbreviations, brevity codes, and acronyms
a. Memorandums. Use abbreviations and brevity codes authorized on the Army Publishing Directorate (APD) website under abbreviations, brevity codes, and acronyms or in the U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual and standard dictionaries for abbreviations not authorized by AR 25–30. Prescribing regulations for various technical fields also provide authorized abbreviations, brevity codes, and acronyms. Abbreviated military grades are authorized for memorandums. General officers will use their full military grades on all correspondence.
b. Letters. Use only common abbreviations found in standard dictionaries. Do not use military abbreviations, brev-ity codes, acronyms, or military jargon in letters addressed to persons outside DoD. Military personnel will use their full grades (for example, lieutenant general, major general, captain, and sergeant first class) in letters.
c. Abbreviation guidelines.
(1) Use only well-known abbreviations or those you believe the recipient knows.
(2) Use a shortened version of the title or term instead of an acronym when a title or complete term will be used repeatedly in a document; for example, instead of “military interdepartmental purchase request,” use “purchase re-quest.” If the complete title or term is lengthy, complex, or not well known, place the abbreviated form in parentheses after the first time the title or term is used. Thereafter, use only the shortened form. Do not use this method if the term will not be used repeatedly. Avoid beginning a sentence with an abbreviation or using them in the subject line, except for words like “Mr.,” “Dr.,” “Ms.,” and so on.
(3) Refer to APD’s website, https://armypubs.army.mil/abca/default.aspx and the DoD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms available at https://jdeis.js.mil/jdeis/. For the online, searchable database, refer to https://www.jcs.mil/doctrine/dod-terminology-program/ for further guidance on correct capitalization when spelling out an abbreviation.
d. Acronym guidelines.
(1) Use military and civilian acronyms in memorandums, if appropriate. Do not use military acronyms when writ-ing to individuals or organizations outside of DoD. Military personnel will use their full grades (for example, lieuten-ant general, major general, captain, and sergeant first class) in letters. When an acronym is used, spell out the acronym the first time it is used and follow it with the acronym in parentheses. Thereafter, use the acronym. Do not overuse acronyms. Avoid using acronyms in the subject line.
(2) Refer to the APD’s website available at https://armypubs.army.mil/abca/default.aspx and the DoD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms available at https://jdeis.js.mil/jdeis/ for further guidance on correct capitalization when spelling out an acronym.
1–16. Letterhead
a. Letterhead identifies the originating organization and provides the complete standardized mailing address.
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 4
b. Computer-generated letterhead is used for all official correspondence. Use the letterhead template provided on APD’s website which is available at https://armypubs.army.mil/tools/pubsresources.aspx.
(1) All official letterhead stationery will bear the DoD seal. “Reply to the Attention of” is not required.
(2) Do not print any seals, emblems, decorative devices, distinguishing insignia, slogans, office symbols, names, or mottos on letterhead stationery except those approved or directed by HQDA.
(3) Use black ink for computer-generated letterhead.
(4) Use the correct letterhead for the SECARMY, Chief of Staff, Army, Under Secretary of the Army, Vice Chief of Staff, Army using the guidance found in HQDA Writing and Product SOP and DoDM 5110.04–M–V1.
1–17. Digital signatures
The Army will replace analog or “wet,” signatures with digital and electronic signatures secured via DoD Common Access Card for most documents. Digital signatures will not be used on letters or for documents that require a wet signature by law, regulation, or congressional tasking. See appendix F for instruction on creating Adobe .pdf files and placing the digital signature box and text boxes for date and comment as required.
1–18. Paper
Paper used for Army correspondence will be the standard size (8 ½ by 11 inches). Use computer-generated letterhead for the first page of all memorandums and letters. Use plain white paper for continuing pages.
1–19. Type fonts and sizes
Army senior leaders will determine the font size and type his or her organization will use ensuring the correspondence is easy to read and understand. The following guidelines will provide the best results:
a. A font with a point size of 12 is recommended.
b. Unusual type styles, such as Script, will not be used in official correspondence.
c. Use guidance in HQDA Writing and Product SOP and DoDM 5110.04–M–V1 for Congressional or correspond-ence for the signature of the Secretary of Defense.
1–20. Ink color
Correspondence will be printed in black ink and may be signed in blue or black ink. Black ink will be used for date stamps.
1–21. Copies
a. Record copy. Make one record or file copy of correspondence after the original has been signed and dated. Record copies should be maintained according to Army recordkeeping system requirements (see AR 25–400–2).
b. Reading file copies. If reading files are used, maintain according to Army recordkeeping system requirements.
c. Copy furnished. Use “copy furnished” (CF:) on memorandums to keep other than the prime addressees informed of an action. Make copies after the original has been signed and dated, to include memorandums signed digitally.
d. Courtesy copy. Use “courtesy copy” (cc:) on letters to inform other readers of the subject if they have a need to know or should receive a copy of the correspondence. Make copies after the original has been signed and dated.
e. Electronic records. Maintain according to Army recordkeeping system requirements (see AR 25–400–2).
1–22. Classified and special handling correspondence
a. General. Information that requires protection against unauthorized disclosure in the interest of national security will be classified. Correspondence containing classified information will be safeguarded as prescribed in DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2. The contents of a classified communication will be revealed only to individuals who have the appropriate security clearance and whose official duties require the information with a need to know.
b. Marking classified correspondence. See DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2 and 3 for detailed instructions on marking and downgrading correspondence.
c. Using “For Official Use Only” marking. See AR 25–55 and DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2 and 3 for the proper use and marking of “For Official Use Only” (FOUO) material.
d. Controlled unclassified information. See Executive Order (EO) 13556 and DoDI 5200.48.
1–23. Identifying a point of contact
a. When writing any type of correspondence, the writer or point of contact will be identified by military grade or civilian prefix, first and last name; position and address; phone; and email address, if appropriate. This information is generally placed in the last paragraph of the correspondence.
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 5
b. In order to minimize the potential for posting correspondence containing personally identifiable information to public facing websites, organizations should follow the guidelines in AR 25–1 and DA Pam 25–1–1.
1–24. Identifying the originating office
Office symbols and/or office names are used to identify the office that prepared the document for signature. It will normally match the point of contact’s organization and may or may not correspond with the letterhead and/or signature block.
a. Office symbols are used when addressing or replying to memorandums. See the U.S. Army Addresses and Office Symbols Online website at https://play.apps.appsplatform.us/play/e/default-fae6d70f-954b-4811-92b6-0530d6f84c43/a/79e92960-422c-4322-ab0e-c9ac3234aeb4?tenantid=fae6d70f-954b-4811-92b6-0530d6f84c43&sourcetime=2023–08–25%2019%3a58%3a07z.
b. Office names may be used when addressing or replying to letters.
1–25. Expressing a date
a. Dates on memorandums. Express dates on or within memorandums in the following formats: 5 January 2018, 5 Jan 18 or 5 Jan 2018 (date stamps only).
b. Dates on letters. Express dates on letters and refer to dates within letters only in the following format: January 2, 2018.
c. Separating date elements. Avoid separating any of the three date elements (day, month, and year) from each other. If absolutely necessary, the four-digit year may be carried over to the next line.
1–26. Expressing time
Military time will be expressed in a group of four digits, from 0001 to 2400, based on the 24–hour clock system. The first two digits represent the hour after midnight and the last two digits represent the minutes. For example, 1:37 p.m. civilian time is expressed as 1337 military time. The word “hours” will not be used in conjunction with military time. Civilian time is used when writing letters. Military time is used for memorandums.
1–27. Suspense date
a. Use a suspense date on memorandums when a reply is required by a certain date (see fig 2–2). Show the suspense dates two lines above the date line, in bold, and in the body of the memorandum in one of the following formats: 5 January 2018, 5 Jan 18 or 5 Jan 2018 (date stamps only).
b. Do not use a suspense date on a letter.
c. Consider the following time factors in setting a suspense date on correspondence:
(1) The number of days required to send the communications.
(2) The number of days needed to complete the action.
(3) The number of days required to submit the reply.
1–28. Addressing
Address correspondence and envelopes as prescribed in AR 25–51 and chapter 5 of this regulation.
1–29. Postscripts
Do not use postscripts in Army correspondence.
1–30. References
List references in the first paragraph of the correspondence. Enclose copies of references that are not readily available to the addressees or list public website link that is accessible to all agencies on the distribution list. List and number references in the order they are mentioned in the correspondence. However, when references are not included in the body of the correspondence, number, and list them in order of precedence and ascending date order in the first para-graph. As a minimum, include the following information:
a. Publications. When referencing publications, only include the number and title (for example, AR 25–50 (Pre-paring and Managing Correspondence)). In policy correspondence, referencing basic directives by the number and title prevents the correspondence from having to be revised and republished when one of the references is updated. Use the date of the directive when a specific version is being referenced and be prepared to provide a copy.
b. Correspondence. When referencing correspondence, include the organization or origin, office symbol, type of correspondence, subject of correspondence, and date. Examples---
(1) HQ USARC, AFRC–ZA memorandum (Training for Army Materiel Command Personnel), 20 February 2020.
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 6
(2) HQ FORSCOM (ATCG) memorandum (Using Date From a Referenced Memorandum), 20 February 2020.
(3) Office of the General Counsel, SAGC letter (subject––if used), 31 March 2020.
(4) HQ TRADOC, ATPL–TDD–OR message, 101623Z Sep 19, (Correspondence Management.), 10623Z March 2020.
c. Email or facsimile. When referencing an email or facsimile (fax), use the name of the sender and office symbol, if included, for example:
(1) HQ TRADOC, ATPL–TDD–OR, [full name] email (Correspondence Memorandum), 3 January 2020.
(2) HQ FORSCOM, [full name] fax (Copier Management), 25 February 2020.
d. Public law. When referencing public laws, include the name, public law number, section, statute number, and date, for example:
(1) National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law No. 91–190, Section 103, 83 Statute 852, 853 (1970).
(2) Social Security Number Privacy and Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2003, H.R. 2971, 108th Cong. 101 (2003).
e. Classified or unclassified material. Use DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2 for portion marking when referencing un-classified material in a classified document or when referencing classified material in a classified or unclassified doc-ument.
f. Paragraphs of publications.
(1) When referencing a publication, cite its number and title: Army regulation 25–59 (Office Symbols).
(2) Additional references need only include the regulation and paragraph number (for example, AR 25–59, para 1–5).
g. Telephone conversations or meetings. When referencing telephone conversations or meetings, cite in this order; type of communication; names of participants, followed by headquarters or office identifier for each; subject, if appli-cable (in parentheses); and date.
(1) Reference telephone conversation between [full name], TRADOC, and [full name], CIO (Records Manage-ment), 23 January 2020.
(2) Reference meeting between [full name], TRADOC, and [full name], CIO (Office Symbols), 23 January 2020.
h. Material that has the same subject. In memorandums, you may use the term “subject as above” or the acronym “SAB” in lieu of repeating the subject. You cannot do so in letters.
1–31. Page and paragraph numbering
See paragraphs 2–4, 2–5, and 3–6 for exact guidance on paragraph and page numbering and placement of the page number.
1–32. Using boldface and italic type for emphasis
Use boldface or italic type to emphasize a specific or important fact. Do not overuse this method for emphasis. In general, substitute more specific or forceful words to gain emphasis.
1–33. Distribution formulas
Develop a distribution formula that is easy to understand and use. Make sure it is a fast and cost-effective way to distribute information to a great number of addresses. Do not use internal distribution formulas for correspondence external to your command or installation (see AR 25–51).
1–34. Identifying and listing enclosures
Use enclosures for memorandums and letters. Number and attach all enclosures in the same order they are mentioned in the body of the correspondence. Identify each enclosure in the lower right corner of the first page before making copies. Specify enclosures in the text. See paragraph 4–2 for the proper listing of enclosures. Attachments to enclo-sures are referred to as enclosures to enclosures (for example, enclosure 3 to enclosure 2), if necessary. Try to reference the title of such attachments more conversationally in text. For example, “See the Procedures Checklist in enclosure 1.”
1–35. Nine-digit ZIP code (ZIP code)
Use the ZIP code on all return envelope addresses and correspondence. The ZIP code will be used on all letterhead.
1–36. North Atlantic Treaty Organization correspondence
All (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) NATO correspondence will be prepared according to applicable NATO directives.
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 7
1–37. Recordkeeping requirements for delegations of signature authority
In accordance with AR 25–400–2, delegations of signature authority must be created and maintained using the record number 25-50a.
Section IV
Effective Writing and Correspondence: The Army Writing Style
1–38. Standards for Army writing
a. Effective Army writing is understood by the reader in a single rapid reading and is clear, concise, and well-organized in accordance with PL 111–274.
b. Two essential requirements include putting the main point at the beginning of the correspondence (bottom line up front) and using the active voice (for example, “The time you spent in training last year entitles you to jump pay.”).
c. Active voice writing—
(1) Emphasizes the actor of the sentence.
(2) Shows who or what does the action in the sentence and puts the actor before the verb.
(3) Creates shorter sentences. By eliminating passive voice, you reduce the number of words in a sentence.
(a) Passive voice: The test was passed by SGT Jones (seven words).
(b) Active voice: SGT Jones passed the test (five words).
d. Passive voice is easy to recognize. A passive construction occurs when the object of an action becomes the subject of the sentence. A verb in the passive voice uses any form of the verb “to be” (for example, am, is, are, was, were, be, being, and been), plus a past participle of the verb, which usually ends in “en” or “ed” (for example, were completed, as requested). Additionally, in passive voice the subject receives the action instead of taking the action.
1–39. Constructing military correspondence
a. General techniques. Focus on the main point when constructing basic military correspondence. Use of active voice is the basic style of Army writing.
b. Specific techniques. Incorporate these plain language techniques to improve effectiveness:
(1) Use short words.
(2) Keep sentences short. The average length of a sentence should be about 15 words.
(3) Write paragraphs that, with few exceptions, are no more than 10 lines.
(4) Avoid jargon.
(5) Use correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation.
(6) Use “I,” “you,” and “we” as subjects of sentences instead of this office, this headquarters, this command, all individuals, and so forth.
(7) Write one-page letters and memorandums for most correspondence. Use enclosures for additional information.
(8) Avoid sentences that begin with “It is,” “There is,” or “There are.”
(9) Place two spaces between the punctuation and the text that immediately follows it for periods and question marks. For commas, colons, and semicolons, place one space between the punctuation and the text that immediately follows it.
(10) Space ¼ inch to the right of the parenthesis when numbering subparagraphs.
Chapter 2
Preparing Memorandums
2–1. General
Figures 2–1 through 2–19 illustrate examples of use and general rules for memorandums.
2–2. Use
The memorandum is used for correspondence sent outside the headquarters, command, installation, activities, units, or similarly identifiable organizational elements within DoD; for routine correspondence to Federal Government agen-cies outside DoD; for notification of personnel actions, military, or civilian; for showing appreciation or commenda-tion to DA Civilians and Soldiers; and for internal correspondence within the same headquarters, command, or simi-larly identifiable organizational elements.
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 8
Note. Refer to HQDA Writing and Product SOP for correspondence originating within Army Secretariat or Army Staff organizations available at https://csa.army.pentagon.mil/ecc/SitePages/Correspondence Formats And Letter-heads.aspx.
2–3. General rules
a. Paper. Use standard size paper (8½ by 11 inches).
(1) Original pages. For memorandums, use computer-generated letterhead for the first page and plain white paper for continuing pages.
(2) Copies. Prepare only the number of copies needed. See paragraph 1–20 of this regulation for more information on record, reading file, copy furnished, and courtesy copies.
b. Dates. Type or stamp the day, month, and year on the memorandum flush with the right margin. See appendix F for instructions on placing a text box for the date on Adobe .pdf files that use digital signature.
c. Margins. Use standard margins: 1-inch from the left, right, and bottom edges. Do not justify right margins.
d. Spacing. See figures 2–1 and 2–2.
e. Abbreviations, brevity codes, and acronyms. See paragraph 1–15 of this regulation.
f. Signature blocks. See paragraph 6–4 of this regulation.
2–4. Format
Use the block style format (flush with the left margin/ with three parts) when writing a memorandum: heading, body, and closing.
a. Heading. The heading has six elements—
(1) Office symbol. Type the office symbol on the second line below the seal. The office symbol identifies the writer’s office (for example, ISES–RM). Other information may follow the office symbol when needed and if not part of the subject line. Some examples are the name of an individual, military grade, primary military occupational spe-cialty, contract number, or bill of lading number. Do not crowd the office symbol line. If the additional information is lengthy, use a second line, flush with the left margin.
(2) Army Records Information Management System record number.
(a) Agencies will place the appropriate Army record number after the office symbol on memorandums. These numbers are available at the ARIMS/RRS–A website https://www.arims.army.mil.
(b) Place the record number one space after the office symbol in parentheses. (Example: ISES–RM (25-50a)). Follow Army recordkeeping requirements in accordance with AR 25–400–2.
(3) Date.
(a) Memorandums must be dated. The date may be typed or stamped. See appendix F for instructions on placing a text box for the date on Adobe .pdf files that use digital signatures.
(b) Place the date on the same line as the office symbol flush with the right margin after the memorandum has been signed.
(c) Express dates in the following formats: 13 March 2020, 13 Mar 20 or 13 Mar 2020 (date stamps only).
(4) Suspense date. Use a suspense date if a reply is needed by a certain date. Do not impose a suspense date without a compelling reason. Place the suspense date flush with the right margin two lines above the memorandum date, in bold. Precede the suspense date with S: (for example, S: 13 March 2020 or S: 13 Mar 20.) (See fig 2–2).
(5) “Memorandum for” line. Type “MEMORANDUM FOR” on the third line below the office symbol. Write to the office that is expected to complete the action. If you are sending the memorandum to someone’s attention, place the person’s name in parentheses after the office symbol (see fig 2–2). Exception: When used for “Exclusive For” correspondence, appreciation, and commendation, address the memorandum to the name and title of the addressee. When a second line is needed for the address, begin it flush with the left margin except for multiple-address memo-randums, which will be indented ¼ inch. Type addresses in either all uppercase letters or uppercase and lowercase letters. Do not mix the two styles. Be consistent.
(a) Single-address memorandums. See figures 2–3 and 2–4 for examples of memorandums with a single address. Figure 2–3 gives an example for HQDA, and figure 2–4 gives an example for an ASCC. When using a single address, type “MEMORANDUM FOR” and the address on the same line.
(b) Multiple-address memorandums. See figures 2–5 through 2–7 for examples of memorandums with multiple addresses. Note that “multiple-address memorandums” is up to five addresses. If the address extends more than one line, indent the second line ¼ inch.
(c) “See Distribution” memorandums. If a memorandum is sent to more than five recipients, use the “SEE DISTRIBUTION” format (see fig 2–8). Type the words “SEE DISTRIBUTION” one space after the words “MEMORANDUM FOR.” On the second line below the last line of the signature block or enclosure listing, whichever
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 9
is lower, type “DISTRIBUTION:” and block the distribution formulas or addresses (flush with the left margin) as shown in figures 2–8 through 2–10. The distribution list may be continued on the second page (see figure 2–8). If necessary, the complete distribution list may be typed on a separate page. On the first page, second line below the last line of the signature block or enclosure listing (whichever is lower), type “DISTRIBUTION:” flush with the left mar-gin the words “(see next page)” (see fig 2–9).
(d) Memorandums “Thru.” Use a memorandum “THRU” to let others know what is being done and give them the opportunity to comment, especially if their comment will affect the action. Use this format when an action must be endorsed by several recipients, in turn. See figure 2–11 for the format for a single-address memorandum “THRU.” Use the format in figure 2–12 when sending the memorandum “THRU” to more than one recipient. When preparing with a digital signature, create a text box for short remarks (optional) and a digital signature block at the end of each “THRU” line for the addressee to sign. See appendix F for instructions on placing these boxes.
(6) Subject line. Type the subject line on the second line below the last line of the address. Use only one subject and write the subject in 10 words or less, if possible. Avoid using abbreviations in the subject line; however, if the subject needs more than 10 words, limit the number of words by using commonly recognized authorized acronyms (for example, DA, DoD, FY, and HQDA). If the subject is more than one line, begin the second line flush with the left margin (see fig 2–13). Type “SUBJECT:” in uppercase letters (see examples).
b. Body (text).
(1) Beginning. Begin the text on the third line below the last line of the subject.
(a) List any references in the first paragraph. See paragraph 1–29 and figure 2–3 and 2–4 of this regulation for instructions on how to list references.
(b) Begin the memorandum with a short, clear purpose sentence.
(c) Put the recommendation, conclusion, or most important information (the main point) next. (Some writing com-bines the purpose and the main point.)
(d) Clearly separate each major section.
(e) Ensure the point of contact line is in the last paragraph of the body of the correspondence.
(2) Spacing. Single space the text with double spacing between paragraphs and subparagraphs. Single space one-paragraph memorandums (see fig 2–13). On occasion, one-paragraph correspondence requires subparagraphs. Sub- paragraph spacing is the same as for major paragraphs.
(3) Indenting. When paragraphs are subdivided, indent them as shown in figure 2–1.
(4) Numbering paragraphs.
(a) Do not number a one-paragraph memorandum.
(b) If the memorandum has more than one paragraph, number the paragraphs as outlined in figure 2–1.
c. Closing. Major elements are the authority line, signature block, and enclosure listing. Sub elements are the distribution listing (if needed) and CF line.
(1) Authority line. See chapter 6 and appendix D of this regulation. Type the authority line at the left margin in uppercase letters on the second line below the last line of the text. The authority line is used by individuals properly designated as having the authority to sign for the commander or head of an office.
(2) Signature block. See chapter 6 and appendix D of this regulation for examples.
(a) Placement. Begin the signature block in the center of the page on the fifth line below the authority line. If you are not using an authority line, begin the signature block on the fifth line below the last line of text.
(b) Format. See paragraph 6–4c and appendix D of this regulation.
(3) Enclosures. Number and attach enclosures in the same order they appear in the memorandum. For only one enclosure (Encl), do not precede “Encl” with the number 1; use only “Encl.” For more than one enclosure, use “Encls.” Begin the enclosure listing at the left margin on the same line as the signature block (see chap 4).
(4) “Distribution” listing (if needed). See figures 2–8 through 2–10.
(5) Copies furnished. See figures 2–1, 2–8, 2–13, and 2–14. Use the CF: line to inform other recipients of the subject only if they have a need to know or an interest in the subject. Type “CF:” on the second line below the last line of the signature block, enclosure listing, or distribution listing, whichever is lower. (Do not spell out CF.) If none of the CF addressees will be provided copies, type “w/o encls” in parentheses after CF: (for example, CF: (w/o encls)).
2–5. Multiple-page memorandums
Try to avoid multiple-page memorandums. However, when they are necessary, consider using enclosures for addi-tional information. If a memorandum is longer than one page, see figure 2–2 and follow these rules:
a. Type the office symbol at the left margin 1 inch from the top edge of the paper.
b. Type the subject of the memorandum at the left margin on the line below the office symbol.
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 10
c. Begin the continuation of text at the left margin on the third line below the subject. When continuing a memo-randum on another page—
(1) Do not divide a paragraph of three lines or fewer between pages. At least two lines of the divided paragraph must appear on each page.
(2) Include at least two words on each page of any sentence that has been divided between pages.
(3) Do not hyphenate a word between pages.
(4) Do not type the authority line and the signature block on the continuation page without at least two lines of the last paragraph. If, however, the last paragraph or subparagraph has only one line, it may be placed alone on the con-tinuation page with the authority line and signature block.
d. Center the page number approximately 1-inch from the bottom of the page.
2–6. Memorandum of understanding or memorandum of agreement
a. Memorandum of understanding. Use a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to describe broad concepts of mutual understanding, goals, and plans shared by the parties when no transfer of funds for services is anticipated.
b. Memorandum of agreement. Use a memorandum of agreement (MOA) to establish and document common legal terms that establish a “conditional agreement” where transfer of funds for services is anticipated. MOAs do not obli-gate funds, but establish the terms for future services.
c. Format. When an MOU or MOA is required between two Army activities, use the format shown in figures 2–15 and 2–16 and as further detailed below. Note: If an MOU or MOA is not exclusively entered into between two Army activities, the formatting requirements as reflected in this paragraph and figures 2–15 and 2–16 may be altered to meet any internal or special requirements that non-Army parties may have.
(1) Heading. Prepare the MOU/MOA on plain white paper. If an MOU/MOA is between two Army activities, DA letterhead is appropriate. This provision may be altered to meet internal or special requirements of the parties involved in the agreement. Center the title “MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING” or “MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT” on the second line below the seal. Type the word “BETWEEN,” also centered, on the line immedi-ately following the title. Center the names of agreeing agencies, separated by the word “AND” on the line immediately following the word “BETWEEN.” The requirement for centering may be altered when more than two agreeing agen-cies are involved or when the agency titles are too lengthy to be typed on one line.
(2) Subject. Type the word “SUBJECT:” at the left margin on the second line below the last line of the agreeing agencies’ titles.
(3) Text. Begin the first line of text at the left margin on the third line below the last line of the subject. The basic text will generally contain, but is not limited to, the following categories:
(a) References. List references that are directly related to the document.
(b) Purpose. Clearly define or state the purpose of the MOU or MOA.
(c) Background. Include a brief background.
(d) Understandings, agreements, support, resources, and responsibilities. List the understandings, agreements, support, resources, and responsibilities of and between each agency involved.
(e) Effective date. Enter the date the MOU or MOA will become effective.
(f) Review, revision, modification, or cancellation date. Enter the date as mutually agreed to by the signers or their designated representatives.
(4) Paragraph numbering. Use the same paragraph numbering and indentations as for general-use memorandums.
(5) Signature blocks. Signature blocks on MOUs and MOAs are unique because the signature blocks of the agree-ing agencies’ parties appear on the same line.
(a) Type signature blocks on the fifth line following the last line of text.
(b) Precede all signature blocks by overscoring as shown in figures 2–15 and 2–16.
(c) Include the name, title, and agency for civilians and name, military grade, branch, and title for military person-nel. Include the date each official signs.
(d) Place the signature blocks in protocol order, with the senior official on the right. If an MOU or MOA has three agreeing agencies, center the signature bock of the highest ranking official at the bottom. Place the signature block of the next–highest ranking official above on the right. Place the signature block of the junior official above on the left.
(e) See DoDI 4000.19 for more detailed information as to the required content of MOUs and MOAs.
2–7. Memorandum for record
a. Use. Use the MFR to show the authority or basis for an action taken. Also, use the MFR to document informal meetings or telephone conversations when official business was conducted (see fig 2–17).
b. Contents.
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 11
(1) Heading. Include the office symbol, date, and subject.
(2) Body. Show all background information having a direct bearing on the matter. Include the authority and basis for the action to inform reviewing and signing officials.

Preparing Letters
3–1. General
This chapter provides instructions for preparing letters.
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 38
3–2. Use
The letter is used for correspondence addressed to the President or Vice President of the United States, members of the White House staff, Members of Congress, Justices of the Supreme Court, heads of departments and agencies, State Governors, mayors, foreign government officials, and the public. Also, use letters for correspondence to individuals inside the department or agency when a personal tone is appropriate, for official personal correspondence by military and civilian personnel, and for letters of welcome, appreciation, commendation, and condolence.
3–3. Response phrases
Do not use phrases such as “The Secretary has requested that I reply,” “The Secretary desires that I reply,” or “On behalf of the (name)” unless the SECARMY has specifically directed using such a phrase. (For letters responding for the SECARMY, see HQDA Writing and Product SOP.)
3–4. Abbreviations
Use only common abbreviations found in standard dictionaries. Do not use military abbreviations, brevity codes, acronyms, or military jargon in letters addressed to persons outside DoD. Military personnel will use their full grades (for example, lieutenant general, major general, captain, and sergeant first class).
3–5. General rules
a. Paper. Use the standard paper size for a letter (8 1/2 by 11 inches).
b. Original pages. Use computer-generated letterhead for the first page and plain white paper for all continuing pages.
c. Margins. Adjust the margins on the page, centering the body of the letter as if it were going to be placed in a picture frame. Allow left and right margins of 1 inch. Do not justify right margins. When preparing two or more pages, leave a margin of at least 1 inch at the bottom of the page.
d. Army Records Information Management System record number. Record numbers are not used on letters. Main-tain the correspondence in accordance with AR 25–400–2.
e. Addressing. See appendix C for proper addressing of letters.
f. Point of contact. Use the last paragraph of a letter to provide a point of contact (see para 1–22).
3–6. Format
The letter consists of three major parts: the heading, body (text), and closing. Each part and its sub-elements are discussed in the following paragraphs and in figures 3–1 through 3–5.
a. Heading. The heading consists of four elements: the date, subject line (if used), address, and salutation (see fig 3–1).
(1) Date. Express the date in civilian style (for example, January 3, 2020) centered two lines below the last line of the letterhead.
(2) Subject line. Type the subject (if used) on the fourth line below the seal (see fig 3–4).
(3) Address.
(a) Do not use abbreviations in the address. Exceptions include DC, U.S., P.O. Box, Mr., Mrs., Ms., Dr., Jr., Sr., 2d., II, III, Ret., points of the compass (NE, NW, SE, SW), and authorized State abbreviations.
(b) Evenly space the letter on the page. No set number of lines is required between the seal and the address.
(4) Salutation. Type the salutation on the second line below the last line of the address (see app C).
b. Body (text).
(1) Type the first line of the body of the letter on the second line below the salutation.
(2) Have at least a 1–inch margin at the right, left, and bottom of multiple-page letters.
(3) For more than one page, type a minimum of two lines on the continuation page (see fig 3–1). Center the page number 1 inch from the top edge of the paper, typing a hyphen on each side of the page number.
(4) Start the first line of text on the fifth line below the number of the page, keeping margins the same as those of the preceding pages.
(5) Do not number or letter paragraphs in a letter. Avoid subparagraphs when possible. When more than one sub-paragraph is needed, use letters of the alphabet (a, b, c, d) to indicate subparagraphs. Do not create more than four subparagraphs. If only one subparagraph is needed, use a hyphen to indicate the subparagraph (see fig 3–1). Use single spacing even when a letter contains only one paragraph. For effective paragraphs, do not use more than 7 lines.
(6) The point of contact information may include the person’s name, commercial telephone number, fax number, and email address (see figs 3–2 and 3–3). This information is usually placed in the last paragraph of the letter.
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 39
c. Closing. The closing has three sub-elements: complimentary close, signature block, and enclosure (see fig 3–1).
(1) Complimentary close. Start the closing on the second line below the last line of the letter. Begin at the center of the page.
(2) Signature block.
(a) Type the signature block on the fifth line below the closing, beginning at the center of the page.
(b) Digital signatures will not be used on letters.
(c) Type the signature block in uppercase and lowercase letters. Do not use abbreviations in the signature block except U.S. Army, Jr., Sr., II, and III. Use the title “Jr.” and the individual’s full title to improve clarity. Do not use a title whenever the SECARMY signs on his or her own letterhead.
(3) Enclosure. Type “Enclosure” at the left margin on the second line below the signature block. Do not show the number of enclosures or list them. For more than one enclosure, show the plural form “Enclosures.” Be sure to fully identify enclosures in the text. Do not use the words “as stated” or the abbreviation “as.”
(4) Courtesy copy. Use the cc: line to inform other readers of the subject only if they have a need to know or an interest in the subject. Type “cc:” on the second line below the last line of the signature block or enclosure listing, whichever is lower. Placement of a statement in the body of the letter, preferably in the last paragraph, is still an appropriate alternative to using cc: to indicate that a copy is being furnished and to whom; for example, “I am for-warding a copy of this letter to (name)” (see fig 3–5).

Listing Enclosures, Placing Tabs, and Assembling Correspondence
4–1. General
This chapter states DA policy for listing enclosures, placing tabs on correspondence packages, and assembling corre-spondence.
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 46
4–2. Enclosures
The general rule for using enclosures in correspondence is to be consistent. Enclosures should be listed only when they have not been identified in the body of the correspondence.
a. Use. Enclosures are documents that come with the basic communication; they are required to complete the action or to keep the body as brief and concise as possible.
b. Placement of enclosure listing. For memorandums, begin listing enclosures at the left margin on the same line as the signature block. For letters, type “Enclosure” two lines below the signature block flush with the left margin.
c. Methods of listing.
(1) For memorandums, capitalize the first letter in the first word of a listed enclosure; see table 4–1 for an example. Do not list enclosures on letters.
Table 4–1
Three enclosures—Continued
3 Encls
1. Memorandum, OTJAG, 15 Feb 19
2. Letter, DOJ, 29 Jan 19
3. DA Form XX, 16 Sep 19
(2) Account for enclosures not identified in the body of the correspondence by indicating the total number. List each enclosure by number when you have two or more and describe each briefly (see table 4–2).
Table 4–2

(3) Account for one enclosure not identified in the body of the correspondence without a number (see table 4–3).
Table 4–3
One enclosure

Memorandum, USAREUR, 28 Feb 19
(4) Account for enclosures identified in the body of the correspondence without a number preceding “Encl/Encls.” The enclosure listing will simply state “Encl/Encls” (see table 4–4).
Table 4–4
Two or more enclosures
Encl

(5) Use approved abbreviations in identifying enclosures. Abbreviate the word “Enclosure” with “Encl” in mem-orandums. Enclosures will be spelled out in letters. When the document has more than one enclosure, use the plural form “Encls” for the abbreviation (see table 4–5).

(6) Use “as” (as stated) when identifying some enclosures but not others and list as follows (assume enclosures 1 through 3 have been identified in the body and enclosures 4 and 5 have not been identified) (see table 4–6).
Table 4–6
Five enclosures
5 Encls
1–3. as
4. Memorandum, USALSA, 5 Feb 19
5. Memorandum, TJAG, 2 Jan 19
d. Identification.
(1) Write or type “Encl” and the number at the lower right corner of the first page of each enclosure before scanning or making any required copies.
(2) When sending an enclosure separately from the correspondence, write it in the body of the correspondence and add a short note to the enclosure when forwarded.
4–3. Tabbing enclosures
If the correspondence has three or more enclosures, tab each one to help the reader easily find the enclosures (see fig 4–1). Unless command, organization, or legal procedures dictate otherwise, use plastic index tabs. Place tabs on the right side of the blank sheet of paper and place the blank sheet of paper on top of the identified enclosure. Position the first tab ¼ to ½ inch from the top of the page. Space subsequent tabs approximately ¼ inch apart to ensure all tabs are visible and evenly spaced. If an enclosure has its own enclosures that need tabbing, use a different color or type of tab to identify these secondary documents. Avoid tabbing these secondary documents unless mentioning the specific in-formation in the text of the correspondence.
4–4. Tabbing correspondence packages
a. To tab a correspondence package forwarded for signature or approval, identify the tabs in the document. (Tabs may be any letter or number as long as they are consecutive and fully identified in the text.)
(1) First tab: correspondence to be signed or material to be approved.
(2) Second tab: document that started the action (that is, the incoming correspondence, message, or tasking docu-ments).
(3) Subsequent tabs: backup information and staff coordination comments.
b. Position tabs on separate blank sheets of paper as specified in paragraph 4–3.

Chapter 5
Processing Correspondence and Official Mail
This chapter applies to both automated and manually processed Army correspondence and official mail. Using these guidelines will reduce cost and expedite distribution. Follow the guidance in AR 25–51 and this chapter when mail is determined to be the most feasible alternative for Army correspondence and official mail.
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 49
Section I
Cost Reduction Methods
5–1. Reducing mail costs
a. Less paper policy for internal correspondence.
(1) General. Electronic media, as opposed to paper media, is the preferred method of coordinating and dissemi-nating memorandums.
(2) Electronic media only. Army internal memorandums should be electronically coordinated and disseminated; coordination and dissemination of hard copy correspondence through Army distribution or the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) should be an exception.
b. Coordinating and disseminating internal correspondence via email.
(1) The originating office will coordinate internal correspondence by disseminating a draft version of the document to appropriate activities.
(2) Electronic coordination of unclassified internal correspondence is the preferred method of coordination.
(a) When coordinating internal correspondence, originating offices will use electronic staffing via email to the maximum extent possible as the primary method for distribution.
(b) Paper dissemination will be used only when electronic staffing is not feasible because of technology constraints.
(c) Correspondence, internal to Army, will be approved via digitally signed documents, as available, in accordance with DA Pam 25-–1-–1. Instructions for creating a digital signature are available at appendix F of this regulation and https://armypubs.army.mil/news/pdf/steps_for_placing_an_adobe_digital_signature_on_a_ms_word_document_re-dacted.pdf. Signed and approved memorandums will be disseminated via email or by emailing a link to where it is posted online (for example, AKO, milConnect) to the required agencies when feasible.
5–2. Disseminating correspondence via messenger envelopes
a. Use Optional Form (OF) 65–B (U.S. Government Messenger Envelope) or OF 65–C (U.S. Government Mes-senger Envelope) or Interdepartmental Delivery envelopes when electronic staffing is not feasible because of technol-ogy constraints for—
(1) Unclassified and FOUO correspondence between elements of an agency or headquarters located in different buildings in the same general area.
(2) Unclassified and FOUO correspondence through official Army channels.
b. Write the complete address legibly. Hand print or affix a label with the address in the space on the envelope. Cross off the last address and reuse the envelope until it is filled up or worn out.
Section II
Envelopes
5–3. Size
Do not use envelopes, to include cards or self-mailers that are less than 5 inches in length or 3 ½ inches in width (height) or 0.007 inches thick.
5–4. Folding and fastening
a. Folding. Fold letters into three parts. Fold the bottom third forward over the text of the letter, and fold the top third back. This conceals the text so it cannot be read and still permits the use of window envelopes.
b. Fastening. Fasten a communication of two or more pages, or one containing enclosures, together in the upper left corner with paper clips or a staple. When correspondence is going through USPS, do not use paper clips, clamps, or similar metal fasteners.
5–5. Mailing
a. Limit or compress a letter-sized envelope so it does not exceed ¼ inch in thickness.
b. Seal envelopes securely.
c. Do not use heavy tape to seal envelopes. This adds extra weight and requires more postage.
Note. See DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2 for preparing envelopes containing classified material.
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 50

5–7. Return address
a. Placement. Show the return address in the upper left corner of all envelopes, labels, or other covers used for sending mail. Type the address directly on the envelope or use labels. Print addresses by hand only when no automa-tion or other method of typing is available.
b. Format. See table 5–2.

5–8. Addressing
a. If correspondence is for the head of a major department, send it to the individual by title. Some examples are Secretary, Under Secretary, or Assistant Secretary of the Army; the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army; the General Counsel; or Director of the Army Staff.
b. Use the title of the activity head for correspondence to boards, military missions, commissions, and other such activities.
c. Use titles when addressing correspondence to commanders or heads of ACOMs, ASCCs, and DRUs. Route correspondence to the head of the office involved (by title), but inform intermediate headquarters when necessary.
5–9. Address format
a. Use AR 25–51 to address classified correspondence for NATO commands. These instructions pertain to the address on the correspondence and envelope.
b. When addressing military correspondence to an individual by name, show the military grade or civilian prefix, first name, middle initial (if known), and last name in that order. For military personnel, use the following Service designation abbreviations after the addressee’s name: USA for U.S. Army, USN for U.S. Navy, USAF for U.S. Air Force, USMC for U.S. Marine Corps, and USCG for U.S. Coast Guard.
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 51
5–10. Address content
Make sure addresses are complete and accurate, including the ZIP code. Mail addressed to an Army Post Office (APO)/Fleet Post Office (FPO) is not considered international mail and will not have the city or country name placed in the address. Identifying classified overseas units could lead to a breach of security. For more information, see AR 25–51.
a. Points outside the continental United States. Address correspondence to points outside the continental United States to the appropriate APO or FPO along with a two-character “State” abbreviation of AE, AP, or AA and the ZIP code. For example—
(1) APO AE 09014–9351 (AE is used for Armed Forces in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Canada).
(2) APO AP 96218–5015 (AP is used for Armed Forces in the Pacific).
(3) APO AA 34004–5000 (AA is used for Armed Forces in the Americas, excluding Canada).
b. ZIP code. The ZIP code is a nine-digit number designed to reduce handling and speed mail deliveries. A com-plete address must include the proper ZIP code. Type the ZIP code two spaces after the last letter of the State.
c. State names. Abbreviate State names on all mailing envelopes. Use the USPS two-letter abbreviations listed in table 5–3.

5–11. “To the Commander of___”
Certain official correspondence cannot be addressed directly to the individual because it requires the attention of his or her commanding officer. Address such correspondence to the commander of the individual; indicate the individual’s military grade, full name, and last known unit address of assignment to ensure the continued identity of the material as official mail (see table 5–4). Do not combine mail for several individuals in a single envelope.

Preparing Authority Lines, Signatures, and Signature Blocks
Section I
Delegation of Authority
6–1. Delegation of signature authority
a. Delegation. The heads of organizations may allow others (including noncommissioned officers (NCOs) and civilian employees) to sign for them. In doing so, they are delegating authority, not responsibility or decision authority. The commander of an organization or the head of an agency or office is responsible for the activities of his or her command, agency, or office. Commanders and heads of agencies or offices cannot share or delegate this responsibility. Commanders and heads of agencies or offices, including all echelons of command and activities, may delegate their signature authority to their subordinates (including NCOs and civilian employees). Commanders may also authorize principal staff officers to decide who signs command correspondence.
b. Methods of delegation. Principal staff officers who exercise their authority in the normal course of their assigned duties do not require written delegation of authority (for example, the G–1 signing correspondence relating to person-nel policy or the Director of Engineering and Housing signing correspondence relating to engineer activities policy). If necessary, the commander may withhold signature authority even for these staff officers. In other cases, delegation of signature authority needs to be in writing and accompanied by an explanation of the material for which the com-mander has approved signature delegations. Individuals delegated signature authority will use their own signature blocks and titles.
(1) Delegation may be in any written form considered appropriate by the commander or head of an agency or office. It could be a memorandum or local form designed for this purpose. Any delegation of authority is to the indi-vidual and/or position at the prerogative of the delegating official. Written delegation should address or contain the following:
(a) A statement that the commander or head of the agency or office retains the authority to cancel or withdraw delegated authority at any time.
(b) A statement that upon change of command or change of the agency head or office, all delegations are subject to review by the new commander who may choose to cancel or change some delegations.
(2) Some circumstances may require an oral delegation. When this is the case, follow up in writing as soon as possible.
6–2. Delegation of authority line
a. General. When a person other than the commander signs military correspondence, an authority line is necessary to indicate that the correspondence expresses the will of the commander. Use an authority line when an authorized individual signs correspondence containing policy matters, command decisions, official recommendations, and task-ing actions for the commander or head of an agency. An authorized individual has proper authority to sign for the commander, director, or agency head.
b. Exceptions. Omit the authority line on letters and correspondence prepared for the personal signature of the head of a command, agency, or office. Also, omit it when the text includes a mandatory phrase such as—
(1) “The Secretary of the Army directs ...”
(2) “The Commander desires ...”
(3) “The Commanding Officer ...” or “the Commander ... has asked that I inform you ...”
c. Placement. When used, place the authority line as shown in figures 2–1 and 2–3 through 2–14 and type it in uppercase letters.
d. Delegated by Secretary of the Army. Only the SA can approve the signature delegation of “BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE ARMY.”
Note. All SECARMY delegations will be copy furnished to the AASA.
e. Delegated to a subordinate. When a subordinate has signature authority, the subordinate will use an authority line to show whom he or she is signing for. See appendix D for examples.
(1) “FOR THE ...:” If an agency or staff head delegates signature authority in his or her area of responsibility, use that authority line (see figs D–4, D–7, and D–8).
(2) “FOR THE COMMANDER:” Documents signed by the commander’s staff normally use this authority line when the document pertains to command policy (see figs D–2 and D–6).
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 54
Section II
Signatures and Signature Blocks
6–3. Signatures
a. Use the regulation or directive governing the action involved to decide on the appropriate signature. If the sig-nature is not prescribed, write the signature as desired, which normally includes the full name. The individual may use an initial or initials in place of first and middle names. The typed name will match the signature. Once individuals decide on their official signature, they should use the same signatures for official actions throughout their employment or service with DA.
b. A signature is the name of the individual written by hand or digitally signed (see para 6–10 for use of auto-pen signatures).
c. If the person whose name is typed does not sign personally, the individual authorized to sign will sign his or her own name and add the word “for” in front of the typed name in the signature block. If an individual in the military signs for another, the signer should show his or her military grade following the signature.
d. For “THRU” correspondence, when no comment has been made, the signer will line through the appropriate address and initial and date the line through. For a digital signature, sign in the space provided at the end of the address line.
e. Federal statute requires “Commander’s Signature” on certain forms. All other forms will have “Authorized Sig-nature,” “Signature of Approving Authority,” “Signature of Reviewing Authority,” or other phrase as appropriate. The requiring document will state who is specifically authorized to sign.
6–4. Signature block
a. General. Include the following in the signature block:
(1) The name of the person who signs the military correspondence. Type it (in capital letters on memorandums and in uppercase and lowercase on letters) identical to the individual’s signature, except as indicated in paragraph 6–4a(3) and the note below.
(2) Military grade, branch, and title of the military official or title of the civilian official except as indicated in paragraph 6–4a(3).
(3) “Commanding” for commanders to denote the active exercise of authority.
Note.
1 Abbreviations or titles designating religious and fraternal orders or academic and honorary degrees in signature blocks on official correspondence are not used unless their use will benefit or improve the Army’s image.
2 Civilians will use only a two-line signature block consisting of name and title, unless a third line is necessary for a long title. Civilians will not use “DAC” (Department of the Army Civilian) on a signature block unless they are attached to or are serving within a multi-Service organization.
b. Placement. Begin the signature block at the center of the page on the fifth line below the authority line. If the document has no authority line, begin the signature block on the fifth line below the last line of the text.
c. Format. Type the signature block of military officials on three lines in the following order: name on the first line, military rank (can be spelled out or abbreviated), and branch of service (must be abbreviated) on the second line, and title on the third line. If the title requires more than one line, continue it on the fourth line, indenting ¼ inch. Type the signature block of civilian officials on two lines: name on the first line and title on the second line. If the title requires more than one line, continue it on the third line, indenting ¼ inch. To preserve block style format on all signature blocks, use short title abbreviations (as outlined in AR 25–30) and any mixture of full or abbreviated military grade and branch.
d. Examples. See appendix D.
e. Internal correspondence should be approved via digitally signed documents. Instructions for creating a digital signature are available at appendix F of this regulation and https://armypubs.army.mil/news/pdf/steps_for_plac-ing_an_adobe_digital_signature_on_a_ms_word_document_redacted.pdf.
f. Military grade and branch abbreviation. See table 6–1 in this regulation for military grade abbreviations. See DA Pamphlet 611–21 for branch titles and functional area abbreviations. Use the following guidance for military grades or titles:
(1) Do not use military abbreviations on letters; use “U.S. Army.”
(2) Use branch abbreviations in all signature blocks on memorandums.
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 55
(3) Use the full general officer military grade on all formal or official correspondence (for example, Major General and Lieutenant General).

6–5. Personnel on active duty
a. Name. Names must match the printed name.
AR 25–50 • 10 October 2020 56
b. Social security number. Do not use Social Security numbers anywhere in correspondence unless required by statute. If a social security number (SSN) or truncated SSN is used, it must be marked and provided the same level of protection as any other document that contains Privacy Act protected personal information.
c. Military rank. The rank will be that of the individual serving (for example, colonel, lieutenant colonel, and major). For chaplains, put the grade in parentheses and precede it with the word “Chaplain” (for example: J. JONES, Chaplain (CPT) USA).
(1) In preparing general officer signature blocks, spell out the military grade. When using abbreviations in signature blocks for other than general officers, use only the abbreviations (for example, LTC and MAJ). In military correspond-ence, grade abbreviations are optional. Abbreviations may also be used in the text of all military correspondence when referring to an individual by military grade.
(2) Do not use the “(P)” (meaning the signer is promotable) as part of a signature block in Army correspondence unless it benefits or enhances the image of the Army. However, it may be used in an address for such things as con-gratulatory notes. Examples are as follows:
(a) A lieutenant colonel promotable, filling a colonel position, when the correspondence requires the signature of a colonel or higher. This situation would warrant using the (P) in the signature block.
(b) Enhancing or promoting a particular program or issue if it is supported by a potentially higher grade military individual. It may carry more clout if a brigadier general select issues a directive over a colonel.

e. Title.
(1) When an individual is serving in an acting capacity, use the acting status title (for example, Acting Commander, The Acting Adjutant General, Acting Transportation Officer, and Acting Post Engineer).
(2) When an individual occupies more than one position, use the title that is most appropriate to the message that he or she is signing, for example:
Name Name
Colonel, AG Colonel, AG
Director, Staff Support Secretary, Retirement Board
6–6. Retired military personnel

b. All Reserve Component Soldiers assigned to the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) Control Group (Retired) will use “USA Retired.”

Abbreviations reflecting professional degrees may be used in Army teaching institutions where these are associated with academic positions (such as dean or instructional positions).

6–9. Signatures of subordinates

Appendix E
Preparing Mass Mailings
E–1. Purpose
This appendix prescribes special requirements for mass mailings, which are defined as similar correspondence (such as letters, memorandums, messages, forms, certificates, star notes, invitations, and surveys) sent to 20 or more recip-ients.
E–2. General
a. Mass mailings must meet all standards of format, style, organization, and content as outlined in this regulation. Commanders and head of agencies or offices will---
(1) Identify who within their organization retains the authority to release mass mailing correspondence based on message content and intended recipients.
(2) Ensure that all mass mailing correspondence is error-free, timely, and properly addressed before mailing.
(3) Develop written mass mailing procedures. These procedures will outline the organization’s review processes, quality control checkpoints, and risk mitigation measures placed into practice to prevent the release of incorrect mass mailings that could offend former Soldiers and their Families, and embarrass or adversely affect the Army.
b. Splitting mass mailings for groups with more than 20 recipients into smaller communications and sending them one after the other to avoid the requirements of this appendix violates the intent of this guidance.
c. Mass mailings will not be used to communicate with the Families (next of kin) of deceased Soldiers.

Appendix F
Creating an Adobe Digital Signature on a Microsoft Word Document Using Adobe Pro
F–1. Purpose
This appendix provides detailed instructions for preparing digital signatures and fillable dates on a Microsoft (MS) Word document using Adobe Pro.
F–2. Instructions
a. Create document in MS Word.
b. Create a Portable Document Format (PDF) version of the Word document.
(1) Option 1. Click the Acrobat menu item on the top menu bar. Select “Create a PDF.” The PDF maker will prompt you to give a file name and the location to save your newly generated PDF file. If an Adobe dialog box pops up regarding saving the original Word file, click Yes to continue.
(2) Option 2. Select File and then select “Save as Adobe PDF.” The PDF maker will prompt you to give a file name and the location to save your newly generated PDF file.
c. You have now generated a PDF file and are ready to create an Adobe digital signature. The PDF file should open automatically. If not, open the PDF file and, if prompted, Enable All Features.
d. For a simple digital signature, select “Tools” located either in the upper left or upper right of the page. Select “Prepare Form” under Forms & Signatures. Select your document and click Start. An Adobe dialog box may appear stating “No new form field annotations were detected.” Click OK. Select the Digital Signature icon from the “Prepare Form” menu bar. This will allow you to place the digital signature box.
e. The date of digital signature is the official date of the document. Create a larger depiction of the same date in whatever font that was selected in a text box placed at the top of the document, across from the office symbol on the same line. From Tools, then the Prepare Form ribbon, select the text box icon and place and size the box to allow room for “dd month yyyy” format. Align the right edge of the date text box with the right margin. Right click on the edge of the text box and select “Properties.” Click the “Appearance” tab to set font to selected type and size. From the “Options” tab, uncheck the boxes next to “Multi-line” and “Scroll long text” and, from the Alignment drop-down list, choose “Right.” The signer must fill in the date before digitally signing. Once the signature block on the document has been authenticated, the document will be locked from further editing.
f. Select the Digital Signature icon from the “Prepare Form” menu bar under “Tools.” This will allow you to place the digital signature box directly above and left-aligned with the signer’s name. With the digital box highlighted in blue, right click and select “Properties.” “From the “Sign” tab, click the radio button next to “Mark as read-only.” From the drop-down list, select “just these fields” and, from the “Pick...” button, select the name of the date text box associated with the signature. This ensures that the date typed in the box will remain locked after signature.
g. Once you have placed the signature box and set the properties for the text boxes associated with it, click Close in the upper right corner to close the tool bar. The digital signature block is now complete. If you need to adjust the size or placement, click Tools, Prepare Form, and you can move or adjust the size. When finished, click Close.
h. For a memorandum with more than one signature, place digital signature boxes for all signers. The date placed in the text box at the top of the document should be associated with the date of last signature on the document. The date at the top should remain blank until the document comes to the final official for signature. When more than one digital signature block has been used, any text boxes remain editable after the final signature unless you assign the “Mark a read-only” option for the text boxes associated with each signature box (see para F–2f, for the steps). Before distributing or posting, you can also “Print” the document as an Adobe .pdf to ensure that all the text is locked.
i. THRU memorandums require placement of a digital signature box at the end of each addressee line. Directly to the left of the digital signature box, place a text box for short comments by each THRU addressee (see figs 2–11 and 2–12). To ensure that the text in the comment box is locked when the addressee digitally signs, assign “Mark as read-only” attributes to each signature box (see para F–2f for the steps). Place a digital signature box for the originating office of the memorandum, as described in paragraphs F–2c, F–2d, and F–2e. For the date, add a text box at the top of the document, across from the office symbol, aligned along the right margin, set to selected type and size. (The official signing the document will have to date the document before digitally signing it.)
Note. If the signature boxes on the document have not been assigned “Mark as read-only” for the date or comment text boxes that accompany them, the text typed in each box will still be editable after signature. If that is the case, “Print” the document as an Adobe.pdf to lock all content before distributing or posting.
